# Cape Verdean Escudo - Euro Converter

## Project Summary

Learning #Python and tired of counting your Cape Verdean #Escudos? Then you might be interested in this little project. 

It is my interpretation of the capstone exercise of [Giles McMullen Python-course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-programmer-bootcamp/). The final function takes as arguments the path to a picture of your Escudo-Coins and the current exchange rate EUR â€“ CVE and returns, thanks to image analysis, the amount of the photographed coins in Escudos and Euro.

I decided to program the classification of the coins relative to the size of a 50 Escudos coin, so that photos from different distances could be analyzed (like in the video). Hence, a 50 Escudos coin must always be in the picture and selected by the user.

The algorithm seems to work alright, but it was quite a challenge for me to find a reliable distinction between 50 and 100 escudos that can be understood by a computer, even though they are easily distinguishable to the human eye. You can check out my code here on GitHub and I would very much appreciate suggestions for improvement.
